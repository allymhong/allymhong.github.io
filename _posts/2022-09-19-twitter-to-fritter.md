Hey all~ Welcome to my first blog post. If you haven't met me, I'm Ally Minju! [You can check out my official introduction](/about/){:target="_blank"} (it's short and sweet). But for this post, all you need to know is that I'm a third-year MIT undergrad in Software Studio (6.1040 / 6.170) – and I'm here to share:
- my analysis + critique of Twitter
- intriguing Twitter stories from my interviews with social media users from Los Angeles

through the lens of Value Sensitive Design (VSD): a systematic, principled approach to designing tech centered around human experiences and values. 

Learning about Twitter's strengths and shortcomings from personal experience, press media, and interviewing users will help me think about what I'd need in creating *Fritter: a Fret-Free Twitter*! :)

# I. Value Sensitive Design (VSD)

## Stakeholders
_**Indirect Stakeholders.**_ There are multiple roles in which people will be affected by Twitter without having directly interacted with it. Here are three key _indirect_ stakeholder roles and their concerns:
1. The Tweeted – those who are the subject of Tweets are inevitably affected, as their information is now shared and posted to a public or private following. Indirect stakeholders include *anyone* Tweeted about – and it's especially concerning for those whose personal information is posted without permission (aka ["doxxed"](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information){:target="_blank"}). I've witnessed artists whose albums/songs were leaked, as well as peers who have been negatively "Subtweeted" about by others (mostly in non-discreet ways, often resulting in [cyber-bullying](https://www.verywellfamily.com/subtweeting-and-vaguebooking-what-parents-need-to-know-460585){:target="_blank"}). Below is an (Urban) dictionary example of a Subtweet:

2. Constituents of Governments, Representatives, and Elected Officials on Twitter – major announcements, newsbreaks, and alerts by governmental Twitter accounts affect constituents, whether they are direct or indirect Twitter users. Most of us are all too familiar with how Trump's Tweets would shift the state of [the stock market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/08/24/unpacking-trumps-tweets-about-the-fed-and-china/?sh=4d95dbb18b6e){:target="_blank"}, domestic affairs, and relationships with different nations like [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/10/trump-almost-sent-tweet-north-korea-imminent-attack){:target="_blank"}. A lesser known story that we've studied in 11.138 (Civic Tech Prototyping with Prof. Sarah Williams) is how the city of Philadelphia utilizes Twitter to make announcements and encourage dialogue with residents. Constituents inactive on Twitter would miss out on local health alerts like this one about a junkyard tire fire in 2021:

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fire Update: Samples taken from the fire have found NO toxic chemicals at levels that would be harmful to your health. However, there is still particulate matter in the air from the smoke. (1/2)</p>&mdash; Philadelphia Public Health (@PHLPublicHealth) <a href="https://twitter.com/PHLPublicHealth/status/1458511038492643336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    But maybe it's a good thing considering that Philly's Public Health Department was actually Tweeting misinformation, considering that [15 different toxic chemicals were found from the fire](https://whyy.org/articles/after-a-junkyard-fire-philly-sent-an-emergency-alert-less-than-2-of-affected-residents-got-it/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter){:target="_blank"}.


3. Consumers of News Oulets + Other Social Media – despite the possibilities of spreading misinformation – even from verified governmental accounts (like Philly's Public Health department shown above), news articles and other social media outlets typically cite or screenshot Tweets to spread information and trends. As a typical reader of news articles myself, I would find Tweets embedded as a source of verified content – which [normalizes the readers' perception of Tweets as legitimate sources and gives Twitter that authority](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/03/when-journalists-put-tweets-in-news-stories-do-they-transfer-too-much-power-to-twitter/){:target="_blank"}.

_**Non-targeted Use.**_ Twitter has been used for unplanned or nefarious purposes. As mentioned above in the first role of indirect stakeholders, Twitter users who are out to blackmail, shame, or put others in harm can do so simply by doxxing, or spread private information about others. People have done so by leaking others' addresses, nude content, and .


## Time
_**Adaptation.**_


_**Sustained Friendships.**_



## Pervasiveness
_**Crossing National Boundaries.**_


_**Widespread Use.**_



## Values
Twitter's mission is to "[give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers](https://investor.twitterinc.com/contact/faq/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20mission%20we%20serve%20as,a%20free%20and%20global%20conversation.){:target="_blank"}." It was harder to find a statement of their values.

Twitter, within its Terms of Service, states that users grant Twitter a license to make their ["content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same,"](https://twitter.com/en/tos){:target="_blank"} demonstrated through their notable Retweet feature.

_**User Experience of Values.**_



# II. Interviews
## Planning
_**Choosing Interviewees.**_ When choosing interviewees and thinking of matching criteria, I quickly thought of Chiara from Los Angeles and Gideon from South Korea, my good friends who are active Twitter users.

* Chiara is a 21-yo fashionista studying nursing in Los Angeles. She's a writer who enjoys reading Twitter threads and occassionally posts. She's your go-to person for popular trends, styles, and news – and she stayed active on Twitter throughout COVID. Chiara has also been active on TikTok and Instagram.

* Gideon is a 22-yo UCLA political science alumni from South Korea, well-versed in "Korean Twitter." He's also a prolific jazz musician, instrumentalist, and beat producer who has utilized social media to post music and create connections within the hip-hop and jazz scene. I knew that with his Twitter usage in the U.S. and South Korea, Gideon would have deep insight into the differences between the two Twitter cultures.

[_**Interview Questions + Notes**_.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a65kj2ra0tiyz5k/Interview%20Questions%20%2B%20Notes.pdf?dl=0){:target="_blank"} Not as organized as I'd like them to be - my handwriting was playing catch up with the interviewees' voices; thankfully they consented to recording, so I was able to backtrack and directly quote them. I also stuck loosely to the interview questions; because my interviewees and I were already close, I didn't need to "build rapport" from scratch – rather, I was able to kickstart into evoking stories after catching up with them. With these stories, I went with the flow and what questions felt right, rather than stick to the outline. 

## Interview: Chiara
> "Twitter makes me feel in touch with reality."


_**Summary.**_

_**Synthesis.**_

## Interview: Gideon
> "It's not that Twitter made [people] act a way, but Twitter exposed people who act like this. It's not that social media changes people, but it rather reveals people."
