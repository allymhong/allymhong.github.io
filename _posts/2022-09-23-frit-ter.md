## Concept 1: Adjusted Concept
Users have published sensitive content without flagging their Tweets â€“ which resulted in users like Chiara (my interviewee from A1) retaining negative mental images with graphic violence ([read her story here on unflagged senstiive posts during BLM](http://localhost:4000/blog/2022/09/19/twitter-to-fritter.html#interview-chiara){:target="_blank"}). There's a downside for posters as well - when other users report their Tweets, or if Twitter finds out another way, their whole account usually ends up getting flagged with: [_"Caution: This profile may include potentially sensitive content."_](https://follows.com/blog/2022/04/remove-sensitive-content-warning){:target="_blank"} These flagged accounts can then only have their _overall_ Tweets pushed to a minority of all timelines: those that explicitly allowed for sensitive content, an option hidden in Twitter's Settings & Preferences. 

*The Problem*: Twitter users posting sensitive content are not easily able to find a way to flag their content at the time of posting. Therefore, when users are reported - their entire accounts get banned, and other users are exposed to sensitive content without any warning.
