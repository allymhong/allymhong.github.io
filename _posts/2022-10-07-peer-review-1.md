Hey Luis, it‚Äôs Ally~ Welcome to one of your peer reviews.

To start off, I loved how you started off in your pitch in aiming to make Fritter more personalizable and credible. And it‚Äôs a thought-provoking idea to allow editing on Freets to prevent users from the pressure of being tied to every Freet they post and/or resorting to making their accounts anonymous (while still denoting that the Freet had been edited) ‚Äì and allows for users to be more engaged without hiding their faces.

**A compliment, about FreetTemplates**. I like your idea of FreetTemplates, and how this concept synchronizes well with Freets, as I find it difficult oftentimes to create a Tweet from scratch (especially with all the options we can choose in adding media). So when creating a Freet, using a FreetTemplate automates adding existing media in the templates ‚Äì I can see this tool being especially powerful when posting about trending topics with the same type of media, so that Fritter users don‚Äôt have to go out of their way to find the same media, and save it to their phone galleries. For example, with the upcoming weekend with Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Day (10/10), I could see FreetTemplates have templates with the proper formats of gifs, possible voice messages, hashtags (if your version of Fritter utilizes them), and relevant photos/videos for people to share how they‚Äôve been commemorating, celebrating, and raise awareness efficiently! (Concept synchronization)

**A criticism, about Freeter Reputation**. I think Freeter Reputation is a promising concept that could build trust and personify Fritter usage. But I had some questions about how it adapted the Karma concept from Reddit. How does the Freeter Reputation calculate its score? Is it based on a clear mix of a user‚Äôs number of likes and ReFreets? How would this make this concept independent? I wish there was a way to more directly denote that users found a Freet specifically funny, trustworthy, thought-provoking, funny, or acceptable to the relevant topic or Fritter community ‚Äì as your OP states. Maybe similar to Reddit, you can incorporate badges as a part of a user‚Äôs Fritter reputation. I think a wireframe with Freeter Reputation could also help visualize how it would stand as an independent concept, rather than a count of likes and reFreets. (Concept independence) 

**A speculation, about DirectChat**. I wonder if any Fritter user will be able to DirectChat with each other, or if any user could just message any other user. Or could this be an option that users could select? Like on Instagram ‚Äì I changed the settings so that I could receive messages from anyone. But Instagram is able to effectively filter out bots and unknown users through its filtering of messages from users I don‚Äôt follow or approve of, by immediately putting them in ‚ÄúRequests.‚Äù A similar feature within Fritter‚Äôs DirectChat may be useful to filter out unwanted messages, if you can receive messages from anyone! (Concept efficacy)

Thanks for your Fritter Converge; to conclude, I encourage you to dive deep into each of your concepts ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to learn more, and I think it‚Äôll be really awesome to see how you dive into implementing your innovative concepts! Hope my feedback was helpful and planted some ideas for brainstorming üå±
