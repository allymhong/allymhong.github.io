To add new projects, simply add a file in the `_projects` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-project.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this project to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
