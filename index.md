Heyo, I'm Ally Hong – welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a third-year undergraduate student majoring in 11-6: Urban Studies and Planning + Computer Science! I'm also a Christian producer-rapper/singer from Los Angeles – my artist name's Ally Minju.

If you want to check out some of my music, feel free to here:

I'm interested in creating tech for good, as well as making music to share my personal story + those from the communities that've poured into me :)
